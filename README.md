SongoPlayz - AI-Powered Personalized Music Streaming

About The Project
In the current digital era, music streaming has become a primary mode of entertainment, yet discovering relevant tracks based on user interest or emotion often remains a challenge. SongoPlayz is a dynamic, web-based music streaming platform developed to simplify and personalize the user’s music listening experience.

This platform empowers users to effortlessly stream songs, manage their personal playlists, and search for music efficiently. A key differentiator of SongoPlayz is its innovative integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This allows the system to intelligently detect the underlying mood or intent behind a user's search input (e.g., "feeling low," "energetic vibes") and return highly relevant song recommendations that align with the emotional context.

SongoPlayz provides all essential music player functionalities including a responsive playbar, seamless local and YouTube-based song playback, intelligent search suggestions, and intuitive mood-based filtering. The user-friendly interface is meticulously optimized for a consistent experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

This project showcases the synergy of modern frontend frameworks with advanced text analysis, demonstrating how an intuitive and emotionally aware music experience can be crafted.
